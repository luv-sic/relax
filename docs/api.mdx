> const { [consume](#consume), [mutate](#mutate), [getState](#getState) } = createStore(initialState)

Create a store instance, use `consume` to access state, use `mutate` to update state. We recommend to create multiple store in your app.

A store recommended in Real world:

```js
import { createStore } from 'stamen'

const { consume, mutate } = createStore({
  count: 1,
})

// an action
export function increment() {
  mutate(state => {
    state.count++
  })
}

export function decrement() {
  mutate(state => {
    state.count--
  })
}

export { consume, mutate }
```

Keeping your `state` and `actions` in one file is more better;

## `consume()`

consume state in Component, Component will re-render if state is mutated;

```js
<span>{consume(state => state.count)}</span>
```

## `mutate()`

Action is a plain function which contain `mutate()` in it, you can call it in anywhere, in React lifecycle fn、stateless componet... even out of React component, so you don't need HOC.

State is immutable, but you can generate newState by a mutable API `mutate`, thanks to [immer](https://github.com/mweststrate/immer).

```js
function increment() {
  mutate(state => {
    state.count++
  })
}
```

## `getState()`

Get the current state object.

```js
const { getState } = createStore({ count: 1 })
const currentState = getState()
```
